# Hex-Game
Hex game i created with computer AI


I made this game while taking a course on C++ at coursera.org

It is a Hex game in a command window

it uses a grid to set up the board, connecting the nodes to each other

it then creates a AI using a Monte Carlo method

When running the application MAKE SURE YOU RUN IT IN RELEASE WITH NO DEBUGGING


Hex is a strategy board game played on a hexagonal grid traditionally as an 11×11 rhombus


Rules

Each player has an allocated piece O or X. Players take turns placing a stone of their choosing on a single cell within the overall playing board. The goal for each player is to form a connected path of their own stones linking the opposing sides of the board marked by their stone, before their opponent connects his or her sides in a similar fashion. The first player to complete his or her connection wins the game. The four corner hexagons each belong to both adjacent sides.
