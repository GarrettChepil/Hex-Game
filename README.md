# Hex-Game
Hex game i created with computer AI


I made this game while taking a course on C++ at coursera.org

It is a simple Hex game in a command window

it uses a grid to set up the board, connecting the nodes to each other

it then creates a AI using a Monte Carlo method

When running the application MAKE SURE YOU RUN IT IN RELEASE WITH NO DEBUGGING
